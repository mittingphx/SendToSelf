# Send to Self

**Send to Self** is a texting app for people who struggle with emotional regulation in relationships—or for anyone who receives overwhelming or unwanted messages from others. It acts as a compassionate buffer between impulse and regret.

Whether you're dealing with late-night spirals, anxious-avoidant attachment patterns, or just trying to break cycles of codependency, this app helps you hold space—for yourself, and for others.

Rather than texting someone 50 times in a row and regretting it, you can text **Send to Self**. You get to express everything without the consequences. If the other person makes contact, you’ll get a chance to review, revise, or release what you wrote. And if you’re the one constantly receiving messages you didn’t ask for, **Send to Self** helps others regulate without needing you to carry the emotional load.

## Product Overview

**Send to Self** is built around the idea that communication isn't just about others—it's also about processing your own emotions. This app offers:

- A safe, private space to *say everything you need to*—without actually sending it.
- Optional **polite auto-replies** that tell the recipient you're taking space.
- A **release mechanism** that delays sending until contact is made or time has passed.
- An **AI-powered assistant** (in the Pro version) that helps you reflect, reframe, or redirect emotional patterns.
- An **optional therapist-matching system** to connect with professionals who understand codependency and attachment struggles.

The app doesn’t judge. It doesn’t block you. It listens—and gives you time to grow.

## For the Person Who Can't Stop Texting

You know that feeling—your mind is racing, you’re thinking of them nonstop, and you just want to send *one more message*. Maybe they didn’t answer. Maybe you’re scared they’re gone. Maybe you want to say something so badly it physically hurts.

**Send to Self** is for you.

Instead of texting them, text here. Pour your heart out. Type 3,000 words if you have to. Yell. Cry. Make jokes. Beg. Do it all—**just don’t hit send on someone who didn’t ask for it.**

**Then what?**

- If they reach out, you’ll get the option to review what you wrote. Want to send it? Send it. Want to delete it? Trash it.
- If they don’t? You’ll still get a message from the app:  
  *“You’ve been waiting. Want to check in with yourself?”*

And if you're ready, the **Pro version** can:
- Highlight emotional triggers.
- Offer gentle rewrites.
- Suggest skills from DBT, attachment theory, and IFS.
- Help you identify when you’re spiraling.

This app isn’t about *silencing* your voice—it’s about making sure **you hear it first**.

## For the Person Being Overwhelmed by Someone Else

You might be getting dozens of texts a day. Maybe it’s your ex. Maybe it’s a friend. Maybe it’s a partner with anxious attachment or codependency issues.

It’s exhausting.

You want to be kind. But also: **you want your life back.**

**Send to Self** helps you reclaim space—without guilt-tripping or confrontation. Here’s how:

- You can suggest the app to the other person with one link and a prewritten message like:  
  *“Hey, I think this app might help both of us. You can still share everything—just not directly to me until I’m ready.”*

- If they choose to use the app:
  - You won’t get dozens of messages.
  - You can optionally get updates like:  
    *“They’re using a regulation tool. No action needed.”*

This app is designed to support *you*, not just the person who’s struggling. You didn’t sign up to be someone’s therapist. You didn’t agree to be their emotional trash can. **Send to Self** helps create a boundary—loving, but firm.

And if this is something that keeps happening in your life—people fixating on you, relying on you too much—this app can become part of your standard boundary toolkit.
